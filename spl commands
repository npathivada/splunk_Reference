where	Filters results based on conditions (similar to SQL WHERE).	| where status_code=200
dedup	Removes duplicate results based on specified fields.	| dedup host
rex	Extracts fields using regular expressions.	| rex field=_raw "(?<user_agent>Chrome|Firefox)"
eval	Creates or modifies fields using calculations or logic.	| eval response_time = duration * 1000
stats	Computes statistics (count, sum, avg) over a dataset.	| stats count by sourcetype
timechart	Displays trends over time, often used in dashboards.	| timechart span=1h count

join	Joins results from two searches based on common fields.	| join type=left host [ search index=logs ]
append	Adds results from one search to another.	(index=index1 OR index=index2) | append [search index=index3]
fillnull	Replaces null field values with a default value.	| fillnull value=0 status_code
transaction	Groups events that share a common field to analyze them as a single event.	index=your_index | transaction startswith="login" endswith="logout" maxspan=1h
datamodel	Searches or accesses data models.	| datamodel "Web_Application" search
pivot	Visualizes data using Splunkâ€™s pivot interface.	| pivot Web_Application count by status
loadjob	Retrieves saved search results by referencing a previously completed search.	| loadjob savedsearch="my_search"
mstats	Retrieves metrics data for real-time and historical data from metrics store.	| mstats sum(_value) WHERE index=metrics BY host

		| table _time host source sourcetype index
fields	Limits the fields returned by a search.	| fields host, sourcetype
table	Formats the output in a table view.	| table _time, host, status
collect	Saves the results of a search into a summary index for later use.	| collect index=summary
cluster	Groups similar events into clusters for pattern recognition.	| cluster t=0.9 showcount=t
abstract	Summarizes events by selecting representative samples from clusters.	| abstract max=10
anomalies	Identifies anomalous events in time series data.	| anomalies action=filter threshold=3.0
streamstats	Calculate cumulative statistics	index=your_index | streamstats count as cumulative_count
map  	Apply a search to each value of a field. 	| makeresults | eval field="value1,value2,value3" | map maxsearches=3 search="search index=your_index field=$field$"
